# Notes app tutorial

Created following Dennis Ivy's 2-part [react / django-REST tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fM3ueN9nYM)

I chose to use create-react-app and browser-router depsite this being recently deprecated so I could focus on learning other aspects of this tutorial, for example I liked how he was setting out the component structure which is something I have struggled to find good introductory resources on. In any case the main reason I am following this is for the Django REST, not react, and I intend to refactor/repurpose the app into something I want to use using a production framework and TypeScript.
